talks with nodes only
every node has one port to talk with the mesaging server
message goes to node and then injected through the control channel. some messages need response.
nodes also can send messages to the node manager and get responses
nodes should manage their transports and connections
nodemanager keeps brief info of nodes, connections and transports which it needs for work

messaging server has one connection for accepting requests from new nodes. it makes cipher.Pubkeys for them and establish a connection with them (through the same port I think, nodes will identify themselves by ids)
after node registering messaging server will run a goroutine for accepting messages from the node, node will run similar goroutine for accepting messages from nm
